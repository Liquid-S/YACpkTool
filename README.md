Changes have been made to make YACpkTool compatible with DRAT (https://github.com/Liquid-S/Danganronpa-Another-Tool)

## Yet Another CPK Tool  
This application is for the reading, extracting, packing, patching of CRIWARE's CPK format.  
It is designed in mind to be used by both those who don't need to understand using the command prompt-- they just want to extract or repack-- and by those who need some more technical options. As such, this tool can be used in either a simple drag-n-drop means or via the command prompt for more options and information.  
**For more information, I strongly advise reading the real README contained in the YACT folder.**
